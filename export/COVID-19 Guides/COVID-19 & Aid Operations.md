Get Informed
============

You have a duty of care to your volunteers, host communities, and asylum
seekers. Be well informed and follow recommendations as laid out by the
WHO and regional authorities. You likely have the most realistic
understanding of the communities you work in - be prepared to act based
on that before regional authorities do.

⛔  Don’t Panic: As the world reacts, we find ourselves in rapidly
changing situations.  But we’re learning more every day. We have a much
better understanding of what COVID-19 is, how it spreads, the risks it
poses, and how to safeguard communities.

✅  Do: Read this guide, make your plan, and take action!  Aid operations
are already being impacted, but we can find ways to adapt. Groups
providing essential services will need additional support to continue
their operations as long as they safely can.  Host communities may need
our help as well, and now is the time to create or strengthen those
relationships.

About COVID-19
--------------

What is “COVID-19” or “coronavirus”?

COVID-19 is an infection caused by the most recently discovered strain
of the coronavirus family. Other strains of coronaviruses include the
common cold, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).

COVID-19 is not the flu, but some symptoms can appear similar.  See this
handout for more:
[https://drive.google.com/open?id=1aj8rjr8YIBDT89bzVpyB2cJOwDTSzFHO](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/open?id%3D1aj8rjr8YIBDT89bzVpyB2cJOwDTSzFHO&sa=D&ust=1586527387762000) 

What are the symptoms it causes?

💡  It can take up to [14 days to show
symptoms](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses&sa=D&ust=1586527387762000) of
COVID-19, and some people may not exhibit any symptoms at all. We now
know from [recent
studies](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover.html%23studies&sa=D&ust=1586527387763000) that
a significant portion of individuals with coronavirus lack symptoms
(“asymptomatic”) and that even those who eventually develop symptoms
(“pre-symptomatic”) can transmit the virus to others before showing
symptoms.  This means that the virus can spread between people
interacting in close proximity—for example, speaking, coughing, or
sneezing—even if those people are not exhibiting symptoms   
  

Common symptoms of a COVID-19 infection include:

-   A low-grade fever 37.5 - 39 °C (99 - 102 °F).
-   A new, continuous cough. New: a cough that you've not had before, or
    if you usually have a cough, it's gotten worse. Continuous: means
    coughing a lot for more than an hour, or 3 or more coughing episodes
    in 24 hours.

Other symptoms can include:

-   Fatigue
-   Sneezing
-   Aches & Pains
-   Sore Throat
-   Headaches
-   Shortness of Breath

If you<sup><a href="#cmnt1" id="cmnt_ref1">[a]</a></sup> develop
emergency warning signs for COVID-19, get medical attention immediately.
Emergency warning signs include:

-   Trouble breathing
-   Persistent pain or pressure in the chest
-   New confusion or inability to arouse
-   Bluish lips or face

How bad is it?

COVID-19 is highly contagious and easily spreads through human-to-human
contact.  Severe cases can result in complete respiratory failure.  For
most people, COVID-19 is generally mild, especially for healthy children
and adults under 40<sup><a href="#cmnt2" id="cmnt_ref2">[b]</a></sup>.
[80% of
people](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses&sa=D&ust=1586527387766000)<sup><a href="#cmnt3" id="cmnt_ref3">[c]</a></sup> recover
from the infection without needing any type of treatment or medical
intervention. The most severe symptoms of COVID-19 require treatment at
a hospital.

If an outbreak occurs near you, the secondary impacts must also be
considered.  Access to camps is shutting off. The world is already
locking down borders, stranding many volunteers and making it harder to
ship aid.  People are panicking and hoarding, so key supplies are
unavailable or too expensive. Social distancing, isolation, and
quarantines will take a toll on everyone’s mental health. The economy
has crashed, putting many people out of work.  See the [Secondary
Impacts](#h.4yicnqj64mvt) section below for more information.

How does it spread?

COVID-19 is spread through droplet transmission.  When an infected
person coughs, sneezes, or exhales, small droplets containing the virus
are sprayed around them. This is called “viral shedding”. The droplets
also fall to the ground and onto surrounding surfaces where they can
survive for a time (the amount of time that the virus can survive
depends on the material of the surface).  The droplets do not remain
airborne.

You CAN catch COVID-19 by:

-   Breathing in droplets sprayed by someone nearby who is infected.
-   Touching a contaminated surface (including clothing), and then
    touching your mouth, nose, or eyes.
-   [Fecal](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses&sa=D&ust=1586527387767000)[ contamination](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses&sa=D&ust=1586527387767000) (very
    low risk but recent guidelines show transmission through fecal
    matter is possible).

You CANNOT catch COVID-19 through:

-   Through animals. Your animals are fine!
-   Through your skin. It must enter your mouth, nose, or eyes, which is
    why frequent handwashing and avoiding touching your face is so
    strongly recommended.
-   Through a [blood
    transfusion](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://blood.ca/en/stories/why-you-wont-get-covid-19-from-a-blood-transfusion&sa=D&ust=1586527387768000).

  
How long can it live on surfaces?  
A study by the [New England Journal
of](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.09.20033217v1.full.pdf&sa=D&ust=1586527387769000)
[Medicine](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.09.20033217v1.full.pdf&sa=D&ust=1586527387769000)<sup><a href="#cmnt4" id="cmnt_ref4">[d]</a></sup> found
that the current strain of coronavirus was viable on the following
surfaces for the following amount of time:  

-   Aerosols (tiny particles of liquid in the air often produced by
    coughing and sneezing) - up to 4 hours.  
-   Copper - up to 4 hours.  
-   Cardboard - up to 24 hours.  
-   Plastic - 2-3 days.  
-   Stainless Steel - 2-3 days.

Who’s at
risk<sup><a href="#cmnt5" id="cmnt_ref5">[e]</a><a href="#cmnt6" id="cmnt_ref6">[f]</a><a href="#cmnt7" id="cmnt_ref7">[g]</a><a href="#cmnt8" id="cmnt_ref8">[h]</a></sup>?

Everyone can catch COVID-19; however, certain groups of people are at a
much greater risk of requiring hospitalization or dying from severe
symptoms. These people and anyone assisting them should take extra
precautions.

-   People above 40, and especially
    above 60.<sup><a href="#cmnt9" id="cmnt_ref9">[i]</a></sup>
-   People with chronic health conditions that reduce their immune
    system’s ability to fight off infection:
-   Diabetes
-   Asthma
-   Certain bowel diseases
-   Kidney or Liver diseases
-   Immuno-compromised people:
-   Cardiovascular & Lung Disease
-   Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)
-   Cancer
-   People who take immunosuppressant medications
-   Malnourishment

Asylum seekers are at a very high risk of contracting COVID-19:

-   Camps and detention centers are massively overcrowded - social
    distancing is impossible.
-   Camps, squats, and detention centers are extremely unhygienic
    environments and there is little access to hygiene supply.
-   Language barriers can make it difficult to communicate information
    and best practices.
-   There is little access to testing kits or healthcare.
-   Refugees who may have long term illnesses that have no access to
    antiretrovirals  medication may be more susceptible (e.g HIV)
-   Volunteers may become sick but show no symptoms and continue
    working.

What can we do?

Strict adherence to a simple course of action will effectively limit
exposure and the spread of COVID-19.  Preparing now means you will be
able to adapt to secondary impacts down the road. Learn more about how
you can prepare and adapt your existing operations further down, and
check out our [Community Care &
Support](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Bfv15HFgNVF_zMPdJiv3J_EZ2S1JIAh-2vbTRBZS3Hw/edit?usp%3Dsharing&sa=D&ust=1586527387774000)

Secondary Impacts
-----------------

Travel Restrictions

Many countries have already put travel restrictions in place, such as
limiting travel to other countries, only letting citizens in, and
limiting access to certain areas within the country.  This will affect
your volunteer staffing.  Plan how you can operate on a skeleton staff
if necessary.

When travel opens back up, it’s important to check in with local groups
and follow regional advice before booking a trip to volunteer.

Curfews & Quarantines

Many countries are implementing targeted or general quarantines, and
related measures like curfews.  Breaking these rules often results in
stiff penalties.  Keep up to date on any new measures, and be prepared
to operate within the additional restrictions.

[Losing
Access](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/10e8Ds1t0hVQ6mjznkiabbIx_QGF_tTCkJDmtP2Uk2n8/edit?usp%3Dsharing&sa=D&ust=1586527387776000)

Greece has already locked down access to camps on the Aegean Islands,
and we’re sure that other countries will follow suit in the coming
weeks.  It is very important to do what you can now, before access is
revoked.  See the tips on how to reduce services or shut down gracefully
in the [Update Procedures](#h.aalbums36nmw) section below.

Shipments & Shortages

Trucking across Europe is slowing or shutting down, and getting more
expensive.  Shipping containers are less impacted, but take longer to
organize.  Plan to spend the next 4-8 weeks without international
aid.  Figure out what you can buy locally in bulk, and stock up on key
items now.

Security & Safety

We have received reports of attacks on aid workers and asylum seekers in
Greece, as recently as March 19th. Be prepared for more violence if an
outbreak occurs in your region. Be aware that international volunteers
might be perceived as carriers of the virus by the local population or
by the population you serve, which may put them at additional risk.

Review your safety plan with your team and provide a way to report
critical events quickly. You should reassess the security situation
daily during a COVID-19 outbreak.

Talk To Your Team
=================

Remind Everyone

💖  This is a unique and difficult situation that we are all in together.
Take it seriously, but do not let it overwhelm you. Remember why we all
came out here in the first place - to help.

💖  Be kind and supportive to each other. We are all going through a lot,
but we are going through it together. We’ve got each other’s backs.

💖  It’s okay to ask for any help you need.  It’s okay to take time off
for yourself.  Don’t overdo it and burn out.

Collect Medical & Emergency Information

Create an up-to-date medical information sheet for each team member
which your coordination team can access.  If you have a HQ elsewhere,
send them a copy.  
This should include:

✅  Name, age, nationality, passport number.

✅  Underlying medical issues, prescription medication.

✅  Additional risk factors such as age, a weakened immune system,
diabetes, cardiovascular disease, asthma, or chronic pulmonary
obstruction disease.

✅  Full personal contact information including phone number, email
address and social media accounts.

✅  Full emergency contact details (next of kin/family member).

✅  Insurance company name, number, policy number, plan type.

Provide printed copies of key information

Create a comprehensive document that your volunteers have on hand when
out in the field. Also keep it posted in volunteer housing and the
office. This should include:

✅  Contact information for a field coordinator who is available if
needed.

✅  Contact information for the local authorities.

✅  A reminder of general precautions everyone should be taking.

✅  A description of your procedures to follow if you suspect a
beneficiary has COVID-19, and contact info for a medical team who can
assess them.

✅  A description of your procedures and extra precautions to take if you
feel ill.

✅  Information on how to access mental healthcare.

Health & Travelers Insurance

Make sure your volunteers are covered if they get sick with severe
symptoms.  This is especially important for volunteers riding the
pandemic out in a foreign country.

-   Health insurance can help you access care and reduce related costs.
     Ensure that your health insurance applies to the country you are
    in - for example, most US healthcare plans don’t apply abroad.
-   Travelers insurance can help refund cancelled flights, housing, and
    other trip related expenses.  One of the most important provisions
    in travelers insurance is coverage for medical evacuation.  If you
    get severely sick, this coverage may allow you to get a medical
    evacuation flight home.

Double check all terms and conditions if you choose to purchase
additional insurance.  Many companies are now including waivers due to
COVID-19.  Make sure you’re getting the important points covered and not
just wasting your money.

Mental Healthcare and other resources

We’ve already learned some difficult lessons about mental healthcare,
burnout, etc.  It is important to continue best practices in this
regard, especially because volunteers do have additional worries and
stress. Ensure you provide your team with access to any mental health
resources your operation has, and have them make use of online
counselling tools as needed.

Empathy burnout and compassion fatigue   
These are two serious conditions that affect many response workers.
Professional helpers often develop physical and mental health problems
such as sleep issues, stress-related physical/mental illnesses and abuse
of alcohol and substances. It is critical for team leads to monitor
themselves and their staff for signs of empathy burnout or compassion
fatigue.

Burnout and compassion fatigue can affect your judgment making, and poor
judgment calls will affect not only your staff, but the lives of
migrants and asylum seekers you are working to help. It is important to
set yourself a clear plan to avoid burnout, and we would recommend
taking an hour to familiarise yourself with the signs.  Denial is one of
the most detrimental symptoms as it prevents people from accurately
assessing how fatigued and stressed they actually are, which prevents
the seeking of help.

Some common signs of empathy burnout and compassion fatigue are:

-   Feeling burdened by the suffering of others or blaming others for
    their suffering
-   Isolating yourself
-   Loss of pleasure in life
-   Cynicism
-   Feeling detached
-   Difficulty concentrating
-   Insomnia
-   Physical and mental fatigue
-   Symptoms of anxiety and/or depression
-   Bottling up your emotions
-   Increased nightmares
-   Feelings of hopelessness or powerlessness, or that you aren’t
    achieving anything
-   Anger, irritability, or frustration
-   Frequent complaining about your work or your life
-   Overeating
-   Excessive use of drugs or alcohol
-   Poor self-care
-   Beginning to receive a lot of complaints about your work or attitude
-   Denial

  
We recommend having team members take the [PROQOL
test](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.proqol.org/uploads/ProQOL_5_English_Self-Score_3-2012.pdf&sa=D&ust=1586527387784000).
If they score highly, you should talk to them and try to support them
by:

-   Having them try to accept where they are on their work path at all
    times and understand their limits, reaffirm why you are doing the
    work you are and the good that comes from it.
-   Create a daily schedule (if your operation is somewhat structured)
    of what their day will look like so that they have a clear plan and
    eliminate any unknowing or anxiety that comes from uncertainty. Set
    a clear time limit of when their workday will end and make sure they
    stick to it to create a routine.
-   Encourage them to take regular breaks throughout the day; have them
    set their alarm as a reminder to take a 10 minute break every hour.
-   Encourage them to exchange information and feelings with you and
    their fellow team members who can validate how they feel.
-   Clarify personal and professional boundaries - what works for them
    and what doesn't? Are they working too many hours or is the
    environment not suitable for them? Plan around their limitations and
    change their role if necessary.
-   Ensure they have a platform to express what they need verbally to
    you or the  operations lead  so that they understand when a break is
    needed and when they need to walk away. Clear communication is key
    as some volunteers may be unwilling to approach team leads if they
    feel they are always busy and they don't want to interrupt.
-   Take positive action to change their environment

 Specifically during a COVID-19 outbreak where you may be working
extreme hours as a response team, you should:

-   Limit the amount of daily news you watch or read
-   Try to come to term with the fact that pain and suffering are
    realities of life over which we have little or no control
-   Be grateful for what is good in your life and in the world
-   Try to find some meaning in the suffering you see
-   If you must blame something, blame the situation, not the person
-   Show compassion to yourself by being kind, soothing, and comforting
    to yourself

Make A Plan<sup><a href="#cmnt11" id="cmnt_ref11">[k]</a></sup>
===============================================================

Our Recommendations
-------------------

⛔  Do not travel unless strictly necessary. Traveling right now is
difficult, and increases the risk of getting infected or undergoing a
[mandatory 14-day
quarantine.](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.iatatravelcentre.com/international-travel-document-news/1580226297.htm&sa=D&ust=1586527387786000)

-   Volunteers scheduled to arrive should delay or cancel their plans.
-   Volunteers scheduled to leave should consider remaining for the time
    being.  Be prepared to stay in your current host country for at
    least 3 months. Double check that an exception has been made and
    it’s okay if you overstay your visa.
-   Anyone who does need to travel should do so NOW.  Contact your
    embassy to assist with returning home.  If you are not tested at the
    airport on arrival, you should follow the same procedure as someone
    who has been exposed to the virus and self-isolate for 14 days.

⛔  Pause non-essential community-facing projects, such as social
centers, classes, sports activities, etc.  See “Update Procedures” below
for more info on how to re-open safely.

✋  Cautiously continue essential community-facing projects, but ONLY
IF appropriate precautions can realistically be taken and you have
enough volunteers to maintain them for the foreseeable future.  See
“Update Procedures” below for more information about how to implement
appropriate precautions.  
Critical projects include food / water / hygiene distribution, housing,
street outreach, support for pregnant women & new mothers, and check-ins
on folks with high-risk factors.

✅  Continue operational projects, such as aid collections, warehouse
operations, administrative organizing, and info sharing.  Now is a great
time to get caught up on your team’s internal backlog or deep-clean the
volunteer house.

✅ Begin support projects within your host community, such as posting
educational information, checking in on at-risk neighbors, and
coordinating with local or regional governments. See our [Community Care
& Support
guide](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Bfv15HFgNVF_zMPdJiv3J_EZ2S1JIAh-2vbTRBZS3Hw/edit?usp%3Dsharing&sa=D&ust=1586527387787000) for
more ideas.

✅  Support<sup><a href="#cmnt12" id="cmnt_ref12">[l]</a></sup> advocacy
projects to highlight the risk that COVID-19 poses to asylum seekers and
demand action be taken to protect them! \#LeaveNooneBehind.

Update Procedures
=================

Every community-facing project that remains open will need to implement
strict but simple precautions to prevent infection and reduce
spread.  Continuing “business as usual” is not only irresponsible during
this pandemic, but it WILL turn deadly.

General Tips
------------

Avoid Crowding

Tips to prevent spread amongst beneficiaries (camp residents, etc,).

-   Don’t create unnecessary gatherings.
-   Try to deliver essential supplies instead of asking people to show
    up to a common meeting point or line.  Drop the supplies off in
    front of the tent (etc.) to minimize contact between volunteers and
    residents.
-   If a gathering or line is necessary, try to minimize the number of
    people in that space at once.  For example, you can stagger
    distributions by calling down 1 tent (or row of tents) at a time.
-   Ensure that people maintain proper social distancing (2m/6ft of
    space).  If there are hundreds of people, it may be easier to keep
    them grouped by tent (etc.) and maintain distance between those
    groups.  This is a great time to distribute info handouts explaining
    safety tips in someone’s home language.
-   Stop operations that will result in crowding if there are any
    confirmed cases amongst newcomers in your area. Find a way to
    continue without causing crowding.

Isolate Teams / Stages of Production

Tips to prevent spread amongst staff, or between staff and
beneficiaries:

-   Divide volunteers into different teams of 2-4 people based on the
    work they will do.  For example: distributions, cooking, ops work
    like warehouse shifts, and admin / office work.  Make sure everyone
    has a buddy (minimum 2 per team), and don’t forget to leave an “off
    team” that can rotate in to replace teams who need a break or
    volunteers who fall ill.
-   Plan team rotations in 2 week
    periods.<sup><a href="#cmnt14" id="cmnt_ref14">[n]</a><a href="#cmnt15" id="cmnt_ref15">[o]</a></sup> 
    Distribution teams should be replaced by another team and be “off”
    for 2 weeks.  If necessary, they can do isolated work such as
    warehouse shifts.  They should not do work that could result in
    additional spread, such as cooking or packaging next-day NFI
    distributions.<sup><a href="#cmnt16" id="cmnt_ref16">[p]</a><a href="#cmnt17" id="cmnt_ref17">[q]</a></sup>
-   Limit moving volunteers between teams, especially from one higher
    infection-risk team like distribution to another higher spread-risk
    team like cooking.
-   Try to maintain distance between teams in volunteer spaces, such as
    the office or volunteer housing.  For example, house teams in the
    same room or apartment.
-   If a member of one team gets sick, enforce strict isolation between
    the rest of that team and other volunteers for at least 14 days.  If
    at all possible, pull them from high risk work (such as
    distributions or cooking).

Limit Contact Between Staff & The Public

Tips to prevent spread between volunteers and the public:

-   Designate 1 team (or 1 volunteer) to be responsible for interacting
    with the public, such as going grocery shopping or paying rent.
-   Minimize reliance on public transportation.  Wear gloves and
    maintain social distancing while on public transportation.
-   Do not attend any public events or go to public spaces (bars, cafes,
    etc).
-   If you start community-based projects, take the same precautions
    that you would when working with asylum seekers.  See our[ Community
    Care & Support
    guide](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Bfv15HFgNVF_zMPdJiv3J_EZ2S1JIAh-2vbTRBZS3Hw/edit%23&sa=D&ust=1586527387794000) for
    more information.

Work Around Local Impacts

-   Follow all local and national laws and emergency measures.
     Designate 1 administrative team member to keep up with them as they
    change.  Failure to comply may result in harsh penalties.
-   Plan around local impacts such as:
-   Public transportation being limited or stopped.
-   The closure of local meeting / work spaces (RIP Couch Bar).
-   Local stores running out of food or other supplies.
-   Curfews limiting movement at certain times.
-   Quarantines limiting movement for certain reasons or to certain
    places.

  
  
Care For Sick Volunteers

-   Create a “sick room” with access to its own bathroom in the
    volunteer housing.  Access to fresh air and sunlight is very
    helpful - try to ensure the room has a balcony, sun-facing windows,
    or access to a backyard.
-   Isolate sick volunteers in this room for a full 14 days.
-   Choose 2 volunteers who are designated to care for sick volunteers
    and can check in on them throughout the day.  Make sure they come
    from separate internal-facing teams, and that they receive
    additional training on [how to
    care](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/150CDRlAAgUvZJ0nP6I1W3x0zkE6-5zxozqkpUnw8tt8/edit%23heading%3Dh.bfmpd8vc5yog&sa=D&ust=1586527387795000)
    [for sick
    volunteers.](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/150CDRlAAgUvZJ0nP6I1W3x0zkE6-5zxozqkpUnw8tt8/edit%23heading%3Dh.bfmpd8vc5yog&sa=D&ust=1586527387795000)
-   Use the same caution you’d use during field operations when
    interacting with sick volunteers (gloves, limit exposure time, drop
    items off just inside the room for them to pick up, etc).

Reduce Service & Shut Down Gracefully

Over time it may become difficult to operate, either because too many
volunteers have fallen ill or because your group begins to run out of
supplies.  Try to avoid a sudden shutdown of critical operations.

-   Increase the distribution amount.  It’s better to get aid
    distributed now because there may not be a chance in the future.
     Can you distribute enough NFI and hygiene supplies to last a person
    or family for 2 weeks?  4 weeks?
-   Reduce the frequency of distributions.  Less frequent distributions
    require less staff and give more of a chance to rest and resupply in
    between.  Even if you can maintain your distribution frequency right
    now, it is better to set expectations and adjust your procedures
    early on.
-   Know when to call it.  If you can’t effectively continue your
    operations, then don’t.  It will only lead to volunteer burnout.
-   If you do need to shut down, try to inform your beneficiaries. Tell
    them how long you expect to shut down for, and if possible send
    someone to update them if the shutdown is extended.
-   After shutting down, reach out to other local orgs who may be able
    to still operate.  Try to help them by providing volunteers or
    supplies.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

NFI Distributions 
-----------------

Clothing, towels, linens and other items that can be laundered:  

-   Wear disposable gloves when handling dirty laundry from a suspected
    or confirmed ill person and then discard after each use. If using
    reusable gloves, those gloves should be dedicated for cleaning and
    disinfection of surfaces for COVID-19 and should not be used for
    other household purposes. Clean hands immediately after gloves are
    removed.  
-   Wear a mask or something to cover your nose and mouth when handling
    dirty laundry that may be contaminated. Follow [Droplet
    Precaution](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/pdf/droplet-precautions-sign-P.pdf&sa=D&ust=1586527387797000) procedures.
    If you don’t have access to facemasks [use this CDC
    guide](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/DIY-cloth-face-covering-instructions.pdf&sa=D&ust=1586527387797000)  
-   If no gloves are used when handling dirty laundry, be sure to wash
    hands afterwards and ensure you do not touch your face.  
-   If possible, do not shake dirty laundry. This will minimize the
    possibility of dispersing virus through the air.  
-   Launder items as appropriate in accordance with the manufacturer’s
    instructions. If possible, launder items using the warmest
    appropriate water setting for the items and dry items completely.
    Dirty laundry from an ill person can be washed with other people’s
    items.  
-   Clean and disinfect clothes hampers according to guidance above for
    surfaces. If possible, consider placing a bag liner that is either
    disposable (can be thrown away) or can be laundered.  
-   Wash all incoming/outgoing clothes in the hottest water possible to
    kill the virus. More information on the virus surviving on different
    surfaces can be [found
    here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/home/cleaning-disinfection.html&sa=D&ust=1586527387798000).  
-   [This
    guide](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/150CDRlAAgUvZJ0nP6I1W3x0zkE6-5zxozqkpUnw8tt8/edit&sa=D&ust=1586527387799000) includes
    full PPE measures.  

Other NFI items  
Groups who handle any other NFI items should check the CDC guide above
which includes what commercially available disinfectants are effective
in killing COVID-19.  

-   When handling items, wear disposable gloves for cleaning and
    disinfecting surfaces. Gloves should be discarded after each
    cleaning. If reusable gloves are used, those gloves should be
    dedicated for cleaning and disinfection of surfaces for COVID-19 and
    should not be used for other purposes. Clean hands immediately after
    gloves are removed.  
-   [This
    guide](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/150CDRlAAgUvZJ0nP6I1W3x0zkE6-5zxozqkpUnw8tt8/edit&sa=D&ust=1586527387800000) includes
    full PPE measures.  
-    If surfaces are dirty, they should be cleaned using a detergent or
    soap and water prior to disinfection.  
-    For disinfection, diluted household bleach solutions, alcohol
    solutions with at least 70% alcohol, and most common
    regulated/registered household disinfectants should be effective.  
-   Diluted household bleach solutions can be used if appropriate for
    the surface. Follow manufacturer’s instructions for application and
    proper ventilation. Check to ensure the product is not past its
    expiration date. Never mix household bleach with ammonia or any
    other cleanser. Unexpired household bleach will be effective against
    coronaviruses when properly diluted.

Prepare a bleach solution by mixing:

-5 tablespoons (1/3rd cup) bleach per gallon of water  
                        or  
- 4 teaspoons bleach per quart of water  

If it’s impractical or you can’t be sure you are disinfecting items
properly you should suspend your distributions until the outbreak is
over to avoid risking contributing to the spread of the virus.   

Food Distributions
------------------

Think about how you can minimise spread between your staff. Create
seperate teams and keep them apart from each other on a daily basis. One
person on the cooking team could spread it to everyone in a camp setting
so it’s important to take measures to prevent this.

-   If it’s possible to house teams separately during an outbreak this is the best option. 
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Distribution teams should wear disposable gloves when serving and
    interacting which should be thrown away immediately after service.
    If no gloves are available ensure that they do not touch their face
    before washing their hands.

-   Distribution teams should implement spacing in lines and instruct
    anyone who is visually unwell to leave the line, isolate, and ask
    for someone else to deliver food to them outside their tent at meal
    times.
-   Ensure any items coming back from camp are washed with washing up
    liquid and clean hot water and then disinfected by the serving team.
    Do not use the same water to wash multiple items as you risk cross
    contamination of virus particles.
-   Ensure staff follow general hygiene practices. Anybody who shows
    symptoms should be isolated immediately and not handle food or be on
    distribution. Instruct them to start a 14-day quarantine
    immediately.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Street/Squat Support
--------------------

If you work in a street or squat team think about the type of contact
you have with people, implementing social distancing is important.
Educate people on how to wash their hands if they can access running
water and soap or hand sanitizer. Let them know the symptoms they need
to look for and ask them to isolate themselves if they are unwell.

-   Teams should wear disposable gloves when interacting, which should
    be thrown away after service. If no gloves are available ensure that
    they do not touch their face before washing their hands.
-   Distribution teams should implement spacing in lines and instruct
    anyone who is visually unwell to leave the line, to isolate and ask
    for someone else to deliver food to them outside their tent at meal
    times.  
      

If someone appears to be ill:

-   Tell them to isolate immediately.
-   Connect them with a local medical aid group.
-   Provide them with information about what to expect and the
    importance of isolation.
-   Inform them that they should go to the hospital ONLY if they develop
    serious symptoms.  Provide a copy of the [SICK
    handout](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/a/distributeaid.org/open?id%3D150CDRlAAgUvZJ0nP6I1W3x0zkE6-5zxozqkpUnw8tt8&sa=D&ust=1586527387803000),
    contact numbers and addresses of designated COVID-19 medical testing
    / treatment centers.
-   If possible, try to collect their contact information so your team
    can check up with them remotely.  
-   Document information about the incident, including the date & time,
    address or nearest intersection, and list of symptoms.  This should
    not be used for formal reporting (without additional
    training<sup><a href="#cmnt18" id="cmnt_ref18">[r]</a></sup>), but
    may help your team identify areas of higher risk.
-   Contact the local authorities if you need to (such as if the person
    has severe symptoms already), but understand the potential harm of
    involving them.  Attempt to go with the person to the hospital, or
    at least follow up with them later.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Community Projects (including education centers)
------------------------------------------------

You should assess if it’s suitable for your projects to continue if
there is a COVID-19 outbreak. If it’s impractical or you can’t be sure
you are disinfecting your area properly each day you should  suspend
projects until the outbreak is over to avoid spreading the virus.

If you decide to continue your projects you should:  

-   Maintain social distancing, have people sit at least 2 meters / 6
    feet apart and ensure no physical contact between staff and
    participants.  
-   Instruct anyone who is visually unwell to leave and self isolate and
    inform medical staff who will assess this person.

-   Thoroughly disinfect all surfaces after each session. For
    disinfection, diluted household bleach solutions, alcohol solutions
    with at least 70% alcohol, and most common regulated/registered
    household disinfectants should be effective.  
-   If surfaces are dirty, they should be cleaned using a detergent or
    soap and water prior to disinfection.  

Diluted household bleach solutions can be used if appropriate for the
surface. Follow manufacturer’s instructions for application and proper
ventilation. Check to ensure the product is not past its expiration
date. Never mix household bleach with ammonia or any other cleanser.
Unexpired household bleach will be effective against coronaviruses when
properly diluted.

Prepare a bleach solution by mixing:

-5 tablespoons (1/3rd cup) bleach per gallon of water  
                        or  
- 4 teaspoons bleach per quart of water  
  
If it’s impractical or you can’t be sure you are disinfecting items
properly you should  suspend your distributions until the outbreak is
over to avoid spreading the virus.

<a href="#cmnt_ref6" id="cmnt6">[f]</a>Suggestions:

Infection rates are likely to be higher in refugee camps. This is due to
a variety of factors, including:

- Having a large number of people living in close quarters

- Difficulty in both identifying and isolating infected individuals

- A lack of medical resources, including healthcare workers, health
literature/information, hygiene supplies (soap, masks, hand sanitizer,
etc), and treatment supplies (inhalers, ibuprofen, etc.)

- A higher proportion of people with other untreated/unresolved medical
problems that may increase the severity of their risk if infected with
COVID-19

- Language barriers and communication issues

- Cultural factors

- Decimated or non-existent health systems and infrastructure

- Lack of government planning, coordination problems

The conditions mentioned above make recommended measures such as
frequent hand washing and social distancing to prevent the spread of the
virus extremely difficult.

provide 'perfect storm' for outbreak:

https://www.aa.com.tr/en/europe/coronavirus-calls-for-evacuating-greek-refugee-camps-/1765217

Specifically mention: overcrowding, fact that in some parts of Moria
camp there's just one water tap for every 1.3k people and no soap,
families of 5-6 have to sleep in places of no more than 3 square metres

https://www.vice.com/en\_us/article/v74q3b/no-soap-little-water-and-no-way-out-refugee-camps-brace-for-coronavirus

Respiratory problems common in Greek refugee camps. Overcrowded. Limited
or no access to clean water.

<a href="#cmnt_ref8" id="cmnt8">[h]</a>Maybe worth emphasizing refugees
are no more likely to carry the virus than anyone else. A number of
European govs have stigmatized refugees as being more likely than any
other group to carry the virus and have used this as a justification to
close their doors to migrants. This is a secondary effect problem that I
see you've mentioned later in the guide:
