Introduction

Purpose

Adapt your effort & empower volunteers. Learn how to redirect volunteers
and adapt projects to serve other communities in need. We will begin to
lose access to camps, and projects will be paused to prevent spread.
However, we can still continue our work in other important capacities.

Build community relationships & support. Refugees and aid workers are
becoming further stigmatized as the COVID-19 outbreak exacerbates fears
about newcomers. It's important to maintain positive relationships with
surrounding communities in order to continue offering effective support
for refugees. Providing care and leadership in this time of crisis is an
amazing way to develop and strengthen these community relationships.

Create positive network effects. If these support initiatives are
implemented in communities surrounding refugee camps, they can help
limit the spread of COVID-19 into the camps themselves. Communities are
built through interconnected networks: the stronger and healthier the
neighborhoods surrounding a camp, the better off the newcomers in that
area will be.

We’ve suggested different strategies that may be more or less applicable
to your community. Use what you can, revise what you need, and share
whatever else you find works!

Community Organizing
====================

Planning Before An Outbreak
---------------------------

If COVID-19 has not yet impacted your community, there are important
preemptive steps that you can take now to make things easier if/when the
virus spreads to your area.

Identify & Gather

There are critical groups of people that you can start identifying now.

Examples include:

-   Vulnerable and hard-to-reach community members: Older people, people
    with disabilities, and those with pre-existing medical conditions,
    like people with weak immune systems, that make them more
    susceptible to serious risk from COVID-19
-   Connectors: People in your area who are well-known and connected
    within the community and can help share vital information with other
    community members. This may include local religious leaders, civil
    servants, or others tapped into community networks
-   Translators: People who can serve as translators if you live in a
    multilingual community
-   Potential volunteers: People who are able and willing to volunteer.
     Identify what services they would be able to provide (cooking,
    childcare, transportation, cleaning, shopping/errands, etc.)
-   Resource sharers: People with access to relevant resources (clean
    water, sanitary and hygiene supplies, food, transportation, etc.)
    that they would be willing to share with the community 
-   Priority information providers: People who have critical information
    that impacts your community, such as local health service
    organizations and government officials 

These identifications can be made in a number of ways including:

-   Identifying leaders for each street or neighborhood willing to
    collect this information about their area (see section on ‘Building
    Neighborhood Pods’)
-   Creating a paper or online survey to distribute throughout your
    community
-   Asking community leaders who they think might fall into each group
-   Using existing community organizations/services (nursing homes,
    existing community volunteer groups, religious organizations, etc.)
    to identify these groups.

After identifying these people, gather and organize their contact
information into the respective groups. Inform them why you are
gathering their information and confirm their comfort with having that
information shared with others in the community. If someone is not
comfortable sharing their contact information, leave them your
information in case they need support or assistance.

Identify services which could be interrupted, limited or discontinued
during an outbreak. Pay special attention to services needed by the
vulnerable populations in your community. Access to the following may
become disrupted:

-   Pharmacies/medicine
-   Groceries and food supplies
-   Modes of transportation
-   Mental health services
-   Childcare
-   Schools
-   Some types of work/ways of earning income
-   Ability to travel (ex. over certain borders or outside certain
    government-designated zones)

Create & Connect

With this information, you can create different community groups online
through apps such as Slack, Signal, GroupMe, WhatsApp, Facebook
Messenger, and Google Groups. You want to create a communication network
that does not rely on in-person communication, so that it can function
during periods of isolation that may become necessary due to COVID-19.
Preemptively connect people who can help support each other, such as
linking vulnerable community members with volunteers who can assist
them.

Suggestions:

-   Create a general group to share community announcements/updates
-   Establish a “buddy” system to ensure vulnerable and hard-to-reach
    community members stay connected to COVID-19-related news and
    services
-   Connect those with resources and volunteers to vulnerable community
    members
-   Establish a point-person to communicate with priority information
    providers to prevent these providers from being overwhelmed with
    messages from the entire community 

Work with relevant groups you have identified to find alternatives to
services that may be halted during an outbreak. For example, if schools
are closed, identify volunteers who can provide childcare. If food or
hygiene items become limited, find community members or organizations
that can provide these resources to those in need.

Inform & Prevent

There are a number of preemptive steps you can take to help prevent the
spread of COVID-19 if it does come to your community:

1.  Encourage the practice of regular preventative actions, such as:

-   Proper and frequent handwashing (for at least 20 seconds using soap
    and clean water)
-   Coughing and sneezing into a tissue if available or the bend of the
    arm (rather than the hands) if no tissues are available
-   Avoiding touching any part of the face, but really the eyes, nose,
    and mouth with unwashed hands
-   Practicing social distancing and especially avoiding large group
    gatherings and gatherings where people are touching or standing
    closely together. It’s best to limit close contact with others as
    much as possible (stay about 6 feet or 2 meters apart from others)
-   You can distribute this handout with icons depicting the
    preventative actions listed above:

1.  Help share accurate and current information

Limit the spread of inaccurate or unverified information. Refugee aid
organizations are likely to be adept at this work given their
pre-established connections/contacts with governments, health
organizations, etc. Examples:

-   Share current guidance from your local health department
-   Shut down rumors about unverified cures or preventative measures for
    COVID-19, such as drinking very hot tea or alcohol, gargling with
    salt water, smoking cigarettes, etc.
-   Contribute what you learn back to our community resources.  
    [https://resources.distributeaid.org](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://resources.distributeaid.org/%23contribute&sa=D&ust=1586527387731000)/

1.  Create a community stock of prevention supplies

Certain aid organizations may have a special capacity to help with this
work if they have some of these supplies in store and are willing to
share them with the community. Aid organizations may also have the
storage space to keep pooled/donated community items. Relevant supplies
include:

-   Access to clean water
-   Soap 
-   If soap is unavailable, hand sanitizer that contains at least 60%
    alcohol
-   Facemasks
-   Tissues
-   Waste bin liners
-   Disposable gloves
-   Acetaminophens like Tylenol
-   Disinfectants
-   If using harsh disinfectants like bleach, make sure to dilute them,
    (i.e. 240 mL of bleach mixed with 19L of water), avoid inhaling the
    fumes, and wear protective gloves and eye protection.
-   See
    [https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/bleach.html](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/bleach.html&sa=D&ust=1586527387732000)

1.  Identify any available spaces that can be used to separate sick
    people 

1.  Identify and address information barriers

Help to break down potential language, cultural, and disability barriers
associated with communicating COVID-19 information in your community.

1.  Address stigma and discrimination

Help preemptively counter stigma and discrimination by engaging with
stigmatized groups in your community (including them in your
neighborhood pod, inviting them to your online community activities,
etc.) and speaking out against any behaviors targeting these groups.
Consider that volunteers & foreign aid workers may also be considered a
‘stigmatized group’ and viewed with suspicion by others in the
community. See more on stigma and how to counter it here:

[https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/reducing-stigma.html](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/reducing-stigma.html&sa=D&ust=1586527387733000)

[https://www.unicef.org/documents/social-stigma-associated-coronavirus-disease-covid-19](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.unicef.org/documents/social-stigma-associated-coronavirus-disease-covid-19&sa=D&ust=1586527387733000) 

1.  Stay informed

Subscribe to updates from priority information providers (healthcare
organizations, government officials, local media) so you can stay
informed, and encourage others to do the same.

Building Neighborhood Pods
--------------------------

Help communities come together into ‘neighborhood pods’: groups of 5-30
people that live in the same neighborhood. Pod members will exchange
contact information, establish a buddy system to look out for vulnerable
community members, and exchange resources (including information,
services like childcare or car access, and potentially even material or
financial resources) to help one another stay safe. To learn more about
building neighborhood pods, see our handout here:

[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JQNZUfcMzorvLiI\_5tJb5sJmNWl1Xx8X-V7Y4pBJ8\_w/edit?usp=sharing](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JQNZUfcMzorvLiI_5tJb5sJmNWl1Xx8X-V7Y4pBJ8_w/edit?usp%3Dsharing&sa=D&ust=1586527387734000) 

Preventing the Spread
---------------------

In addition to continuing to take the preventive measures outlined above
on page 5, providing community members with information about COVID-19
can help prevent the spread of the virus. Suggestions:

-   Ensure community members know the signs of COVID-19. The following
    symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure:
-   Fever (may be low grade)
-   Cough
-   Shortness of breath

-   Ensure community members know what to do if they are feeling unwell
    or think they could have been exposed to COVID-19. Here is our
    handout for newcomers with that information:

[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-z5RTS\_t97OOopjBtVxRRxihG5jDwRbkjdh5mLzUUco/edit\#heading=h.60iypojhhge4](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-z5RTS_t97OOopjBtVxRRxihG5jDwRbkjdh5mLzUUco/edit%23heading%3Dh.60iypojhhge4&sa=D&ust=1586527387735000)

-   If an individual who believes they may have COVID-19 needs supplies
    or assistance, volunteers should:
-   Avoid entering the house of or being in the same room with the
    individual: drop supplies off outside of the door. If this is not
    possible, be separated from the individual as much as you can
-   Frequently wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20
    seconds (or use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol)
-   Avoid touching their eyes/nose/mouth, especially with unwashed hands
-   Wear a facemask and ask the individual to wear a facemask in advance
    of the visit
-   Avoid sharing any household items that the individual has been using
-   Ask the individual to clean all “high-touch” surfaces, such as
    counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, toilets, phones,
    keyboards, tablets, and bedside tables, every day and especially
    prior to the care visit
-   Care for pets in the home, as people who may have COVID-19 are
    advised not to handle or care for animals

Community Care
==============

In addition to stopping the spread of COVID-19, protecting vulnerable
populations in your community includes supporting people’s mental and
emotional health. Self-isolation and the canceling of many social
activities or other opportunities for social interaction (such as
school, work, and community/volunteer/religious groups) can negatively
impact emotional and mental health. People with underlying mental health
conditions such as depression, anxiety, OCD, PTSD, addiction, and eating
disorders may be particularly affected.

The following care initiatives and activity suggestions are meant to
boost morale, develop community solidarity, allow for social
interaction/activity while maintaining physical distance, and provide
emotional support for struggling community members.

Community Care Initiatives
--------------------------

Electronic support groups

Your neighborhood pod or broader community can create electronic support
groups for people struggling with anxiety, depression, or other mental
health concerns that have arisen or been exacerbated due to COVID-19. It
is important for those with severe or escalating mental health concerns
to seek actual treatment from a licensed medical professional. However,
emotional support groups can be a good outlet to discuss feelings and
offer sympathy, advice, and support.  

Tools

-   Use
    [Signal](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.signal.org/&sa=D&ust=1586527387738000),
    [WhatsApp](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.whatsapp.com/download&sa=D&ust=1586527387739000),
    [Telegram](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.telegram.org&sa=D&ust=1586527387739000),
    [Google
    Groups](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://groups.google.com&sa=D&ust=1586527387739000) or
    another service that people can access on multiple devices with
    different methods of connection
-   Consider also whether your group should have an admin/moderator and
    choose a platform that allows an admin to delete comments that
    violate group guidelines
-   Choose platforms that allow a variety of media (i.e. video through
    [Loom](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.loom.com&sa=D&ust=1586527387740000)),
    and allow individual users to connect with other group members
    without sharing personal data 

Activities

-   Ask each member to share a brief check-in at the beginning of each
    day
-   Check in with at least one other member (rotate through the group)
    individually each day
-   Have regularly-scheduled discussion topics pertinent to your support
    group’s concern or issue
-   Set “mini-challenges” for members and ask them to share their
    celebrations
-   Ask members to share positive articles they find about how to deal
    with the concern at hand
-   Find more activities at
    [https://positivepsychology.com/group-therapy/\#adults-group-therapy](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://positivepsychology.com/group-therapy/%23adults-group-therapy&sa=D&ust=1586527387741000) such
    as:
-   Personal Growth Goal Setting
-   Mindful Speaking
-   Strength Spotting
-   Intentional Check-ins

Guidelines

-   Make sure information on how to join is posted publicly. These
    groups work best when they are made up of a wide group of people,
    who may not be otherwise socially close.
-   Make communication guidelines clear. You can use 3-5 quick rules
    such as:
-   Stay Positive - don’t share fear mongering articles or negatively
    comment on what others share
-   Constructive Support - comments and responses should be supportive
    rather than critical, and should be solution-oriented
-   Listen First, Speak Later - empathy and creating open space often
    mean more than trying to fix someone else’s problems

        Be prepared to enforce these rules by removing posts as needed.

-   Set some ground rules. You can decide what these are for your group
    but some structure will be helpful.
-   See examples below, adapted from
    [https://positivepsychology.com/group-therapy/](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://positivepsychology.com/group-therapy/&sa=D&ust=1586527387742000)
-   Attend: It’s important to check on how others are doing regularly.
    We all need a sympathetic ear!
-   Maintain Confidentiality: Allow users to join anonymously/with a
    pseudonym, and remember that these may be people you know in real
    life. Do not reveal any information you know about someone else to
    the group, and everything that happens in the group stays in the
    group.
-   Communicate with Words, Not Actions: This of course applies only to
    online groups. As tempting as it may be to ask or offer tangible
    help in these situations, this is not the forum for those
    discussions, and it’s important to keep the conversation on topic.
    Also, you never know how someone else will respond to physical
    touch, gifts, etc. Instead, offer verbal encouragement or
    suggestions to empower others to engage with their concerns in ways
    they are comfortable with.
-   No Socializing: Again, difficult if you’re starting this in
    neighborhoods, but this is a reminder to separate support group from
    in-person relationships, even if you already know someone in the
    group personally. Do not use this platform to suggest external
    socializing with the group or individuals in it, unless it is a
    whole-group meetup specifically to go through an exercise together.
    Do not discuss what was talked about in the group with members you
    happened to already know.
-   Participate: The most important guideline! Groups only work if
    everyone participates regularly.

Sharing mental health resources

Encourage community members to share mental health resources such as
links, apps, and books. A number of tech mental/emotional health
resources are identified below in the ‘Tech Tools/Resources’ section.

Share video streaming services

For those that are comfortable, sharing Netflix/Hulu/Showtime passwords
with a few neighbors can help people cope with the boredom and monotony
of self-isolation.

Community Workouts

Physical exercise is an important factor in mental well-being, but can
be hard to do at home/in self-isolation, either due to a lack of
resources or to a lack of motivation. A number of workout apps and
online resources are identified below in the ‘Tech Tools/Resources’
section. Community members can create an exercise support group to check
in and keep each other accountable. Workout apps like Strava can let
community remembers record their exercise progress and share it with
others. Additionally, people can organize ‘community workouts’ that
still allow for social distancing, including:

-   Picking a daily running or walking trail for interested community
    members to complete
-   Having a volunteer lead a online workout class designed for people
    working out from home/with limited equipment 
-   Having a volunteer lead a small group workout in a local park or
    open field that allows for appropriate social distancing (the CDC
    recommends staying 6 feet or 2 meters apart) 
-   Having a volunteer demonstrate workouts from a rooftop that
    self-isolated people can follow along with from their balconies
-   Posting daily or weekly workout routines for interested community
    members that they can complete from home/with limited equipment 

Thank You Campaign

Write emails expressing gratitude or encouragement to those continuing
to work to serve the community despite COVID-19 risks. Suggested
recipients include doctors/nurses/healthcare staff, waste collectors and
sanitation workers, mail carriers, grocery store and other essential
store workers, and government agency personnel. Community members can
also create signs to hang in their windows/on their balconies thanking
workers. Note: we have suggested emails rather than letters as it is
unclear whether COVID-19 could pass through sending letters

Community Activity Suggestions
------------------------------

Studies show that social connection improves both physical health and
emotional/mental well-being (see sources below). Below is a list of
community activities that can take place even during social distancing
and self-isolation.

Community Garden

If you have the space and resources, planting a neighborhood garden can
be a great way to keep your community feeling connected. If your garden
space is too small to allow for social distancing, Interested people can
sign up to work the garden on different days/shifts. This activity has
the additional benefit of boosting community morale if you plant a
beautiful flower garden for all to enjoy, or supplementing limited
resources if you choose to plant a fruit/vegetable/herb garden.

Email Writing

Community members can sign up to become email pals, either with each
other or with an external group. While this may differ based on your
country, some countries have programs allowing you to email incarcerated
persons.

Quarantine Dinner

Pick a recipe and a friend or two. Find something you can all cook at
the same time, video chat while you’re cooking and have a meal with
company!

Some suggestions:

-   Use a website like
    [fridgetotable.com](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://fridgetotable.com&sa=D&ust=1586527387746000) to
    find creative ways to cook what you already have, rather than going
    out to get more ingredients
-   If you’re able, make an extra serving to put in a clean reusable
    container for a neighbor who may not be able to get groceries or
    cook for themselves
-   Make a point of setting the table, even if it’s just for one!
-   Meals are great opportunities to have deeper conversations. Here’s a
    [conversation starter
    generator](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.conversationstarters.com/generator.php&sa=D&ust=1586527387747000) if
    you’re looking for ideas

Book Club

Find a group, pick a book or some articles, and meet weekly online or
via phone to discuss what you’re reading!

At Home Movie Night

Pick a movie and set a date/time - community members can then all watch
the same movie together while remaining separated in their homes. You
can also stream a movie while on a video call together or try:
[https://www.netflixparty.com/](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.netflixparty.com/&sa=D&ust=1586527387747000) 

Talent Show

Interested people can sign up to perform a talent that they already
have, or one that they plan to learn while self-isolating. The talent
show can take place either virtually, if social distancing measures are
still in place, or it can be planned to occur in person in the future
one there is no longer a risk of COVID-19 as a form of community
celebration. Pets can also star in an online pet/animal show-and-tell!

Games

Play interactive games with others through apps, such as Words with
Friends or Chess with Friends. Certain board games and card games can
also be played together over a video call

Online Activities

-   Keep an ongoing google hangouts session that people can join during
    the day if they feel like chatting 
-   Create a music playlist that community members can listen and add
    to 
-   Start a community video game channel (like Minecraft)

Volunteer Safety While Organizing 
=================================

There are three key safety areas relevant to community organizing during
COVID-19 outbreaks:

-   Health safety (preventing COVID-19 infections)
-   Physical safety (non-COVID related physical safety concerns)
-   Mental & emotional wellbeing

Health safety guidelines have been outlined in the ‘Preventing the
Spread’ sub-section of ‘Community Organizing’. Thus, this section will
focus on the physical safety and mental/emotional wellbeing of
volunteers undertaking community organizing.

Physical Safety

Though we highly recommend just leaving flyers/notes with information on
your neighbor’s doorsteps to prevent the potential spread of COVID-19,
creating neighborhood pods and community organizing may involve going to
door-to-door and interacting with neighbors that you do not know (such
as if you are delivering supplies to the door of an infected person).
This work may also entail distributing your contact information to
different people. It is important to prioritize your physical safety.
While we are unable to create a comprehensive guide to maintaining
physical safety in every organizing context, here is a list of general
safety tips to keep in mind:

1.  Any safety training/guidance offered by your aid organization is
    likely applicable to community organizing work as well. Review those
    guidelines and discuss any questions or concerns with your
    organization.

1.  Have a buddy system or check-in system, especially if you are going
    door-to-door in a less familiar area. Tell your
    supervisor/organization exactly when and where you are planning on
    working

1.  Do not go door-to-door in less familiar areas at night or when it is
    dark out. Make sure to adhere to your government’s curfew rules

1.  Do NOT enter the homes of strangers (both for your own physical
    safety and given the potential to spread COVID-19)

1.  Stay aware of reports of violence/escalating tension in your area,
    especially if there are any instances of violence against aid
    workers

1.  Talk to locals and community members who can advise you on their
    particular neighborhood/area

1.  If you are worried about giving out your personal contact
    information, discuss alternatives (like setting up a new email
    through your aid organization) with your supervisor

1.  Trust your gut. You are here to help people, but not at the cost of
    compromising your own physical safety

Mental & Emotional Wellbeing

Many aid organizations already have policies in place to support their
volunteers’ mental and emotional well-being. Some additional
suggestions:

1.  Hold daily/weekly virtual team check-ins to gauge volunteers’
    well-being. While many aid organizations already have a similar
    system in place, it is important to continue this practice even in
    times of social distancing/self-isolation and even when volunteers
    are engaged in community organizing rather than their regular
    refugee support work

1.  Make sure volunteers are aware of the mental/emotional health
    resources that your organization has available. See additional
    resources from this guide listed under the ‘Mental Health’
    sub-section of ‘Tech Tools/Resources’ above

1.  Form a virtual emotional support group that supports volunteers who
    are struggling while allowing for social distancing/self-isolation

1.  Encourage volunteers to come forward and speak to their supervisor
    if they concerns about their mental or emotional health: make sure
    they know who they can talk to if they’re struggling or need help
