PHOTOS: When posting photos of refugees, please consider first whether
you would want a picture of yourself circulating in similar
circumstances, or of your child? Posts about missing persons need be
thought through first --the people in question may not want to be found.
If you do post pictures of people, make sure you have consent from those
in the photo and that they know and understand what they are consenting
to and that the photos might be posted on a public forum such as
Facebook (this needs to be done in a language that they understand).
Please do not post photos of children, we do not always know who is
joining our group and we have had to remove people from the group when
we found out their background.
