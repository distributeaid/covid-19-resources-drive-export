What to do if you think someone is infected
-------------------------------------------

When someone is S.I.C.K:

S -         STOP

I -        ISOLATE

C -         CARE

K -         KEEP OBSERVING  

If someone presents with symptoms follow your plan unless you have been
provided one by the medical team inside the camp.  
  
Do not bring this person unannounced to a hospital or clinic in the camp
where they may infect others and cause the virus to spread.  
  
✅ Inform patient to immediately self quarantine in a well ventilated
area for at least 14 days to see if any symptoms present. This could be
inside a tent, in a designated camp area or in a room with good
ventilation. They must have no physical contact with others.   
✅ Food and water should be delivered to this person separately and be
left outside the isolation area for them to pick up themselves to
minimise risk of transmission. Ask them to allocate a friend or family
member to collect food and water.  
✅ Dishes, cutlery, and cups used by a possibly sick person should be
washed separately from others in hot soapy water, and this water must
not be used to clean anything else.
