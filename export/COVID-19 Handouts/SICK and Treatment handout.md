What to do if you think someone is infected
-------------------------------------------

When someone is S.I.C.K:

S -         STOP

I -        ISOLATE

C -         CARE

K -         KEEP OBSERVING  
  
If someone presents symptoms follow your plan unless you have been
provided one by the medical team inside the camp.  
  
🚫 Do not bring any unwell person unannounced to a hospital or clinic in
the camp where they may infect others and cause the virus to spread.  
  
✅ Inform patient to immediately self-isolate in a well ventilated area
for at least 14 days to see if any symptoms present. This could be
inside a tent, in a designated camp area or in a room with good
ventilation. They must have no physical contact with others.  
  
✅ Food and water should be delivered to this person separately and be
left outside the isolation area for them to pick up themselves to
minimise risk of transmission. Ask them to allocate a friend or family
member to collect food and water.  
  
✅ Dishes, cutlery, and cups used by a possibly sick person should be
washed separately from others in hot soapy water, and this water must
not be used to clean anything else.   
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

Treatment
---------

🚫 Do not bring any unwell person unannounced to a hospital or clinic in
the camp where they may infect others and cause the virus to spread.  

Antibiotics: Not Effective  
Antibiotics do not work to treat viruses, including COVID-19. There is
currently no vaccine or antiviral medicine for this strain. You can:  

✅ Treat the symptoms by taking paracetamol

✅ Drink lots of fluids to stay hydrated  
✅ If you need to share the space you are isolated in, you should wear a
mask

✅ Stay in isolation, sleep and rest as much as you can so your body can
recover  

If you are critically unwell or have respiratory problems, contact a
medical
professional<sup><a href="#cmnt1" id="cmnt_ref1">[a]</a></sup> who will
make an assessment and continue to self-isolate until told otherwise.

  
When to Seek Medical
Attention<sup><a href="#cmnt2" id="cmnt_ref2">[b]</a></sup>:

If you develop emergency warning signs for COVID-19 get medical
attention immediately. Emergency warning signs include but are not
limited to:

❗ Trouble breathing.  
❗ Persistent pain or pressure in the chest.  
❗ New confusion or inability to arouse.  
❗ Bluish lips or face.  
❗ Any other symptom that is severe or concerning.

If you are concerned about an asylum seeker showing symptoms inside a
camp setting you should:

✅ Instruct them to self-isolate and not touch anyone.

✅ Tell the appropriate medical professional in your setting.

✅ Follow their procedures as instructed.

Personal Protective Equipment 
-----------------------------

Gloves: Necessary For High-Contact Or High-Volume Services

If you are dealing with a high volume of people, or with people who are
in isolation, you should wear disposable gloves during operations.  
  
✅ Throw the gloves away into a lined bin after each service and do not
touch your face until you have washed your hands.  
✅ If you have reusable gloves, wash them at the highest temperature
setting after each use and let them dry completely before using again.  
✅Use the same reusable gloves for service after they are cleaned and do
not use them for any other operations.  

Masks: Limited Use

Masks are not effective in stopping the spread of Coronavirus. You are
more likely to transmit the virus from your hands by adjusting the mask.

  
A mask should be worn in only two cases:  
✅ If someone is exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) to
act as a barrier to stop the spread of droplets.  
✅ If you are caring for someone who has (or is suspected of having)
COVID-19 and need to physically interact with them.  
Disposable masks can only be used once, and when the mask is damp or wet
it must be replaced. Masks are effective only when used in combination
with frequent hand cleansing. If you wear a mask, then you must know how
to use it and dispose of it properly. Read this guide:

If you have access to N95 masks read this guide before using. They must
be properly fitted and put on correctly to be effective:

after the initial release, it could be cool to lookup who to contact in
relevant countries and add a link in here to that list
