General Tips & Limiting Spread:
-------------------------------

PracticeÂ good hand and respiratory hygiene.Â If there is an outbreak of
COVID-19 you should:  
  
âœ… Wash your handsÂ properlyÂ (for at least 20 seconds) with soap and clean
water on a regular basis throughout the day.  
âœ… Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer as a secondary option. It must be
over 60% ethanol or 70% isopropanol.Â  Anything under that percent will
not kill the virus. Common individual hand sanitizer bottles only have
40-50%, so read the label!

âœ… Cough or sneeze into a tissue, throw it away in a lined waste bin, and
then wash your hands. If you do not have a tissue, sneeze into the bend
of your arm rather than into your hands.

âœ… Donâ€™t touch your face.Â You can carry the virus on your hands and
transfer it into your body through your mouth, nose or eyes. Always wash
your hands before touching your face.

âœ… Wash your hands after touching any common surfaces.

âœ… Wipe down all common surfaces daily with a disinfectant. Diluted
household bleach solutions, alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol,
and most common regulated/registered household disinfectants should be
effective.

âœ… Maintain social distance.Â Keep yourself at least 2 metres (6
feet)Â apart from other people, especially in public. Â Many people carry
and spread the virus for 1-2 weeks but do not develop symptoms or appear
ill. Â You cannot tell who is sick and who is not.

âœ… Avoid unnecessary international travel, and limit visiting crowded
places for longer periods of time. Â For example, go shopping at off-peak
hours so it is less crowded and faster to complete.

ðŸš« Do not bring any unwell person unannounced to a hospital or clinic in
the camp where they may infect others and cause the virus to spread.

WASH protocols
--------------

Follow WASH protocols in all places to help limit the spread. It is
important that people do not use the same water to wash their hands from
a communal
bowl.<sup><a href="#cmnt1" id="cmnt_ref1">[a]</a><a href="#cmnt2" id="cmnt_ref2">[b]</a></sup>  
  
âœ… Educate people on how to wash their hands properly.  
âœ… If soap and water are not available, hand sanitizer with over 62%
alcohol content is a good alternative.  
âœ… Put visual resources/reminders at all hand washing stations and places
where there is access to water.  
âœ… If you are struggling to find soap or hand sanitizer do make your own
hand rub as recommended by the WHO. Ensure you follow the guide
precisely. This rub will be drying on the hands so if itâ€™s possible to
source hand lotion this will help reduce the chance of dry and cracked
hands.

<a href="#cmnt_ref1" id="cmnt1">[a]</a>From Nancy:

Should we be addressing common/cultural religious practices? Ex.
communion out of a single cup for Catholics, washing feet before
entering temple for Hindus, religious rituals around burial/treatment of
the dead, large religious celebrations that entail crowds like Purim,
etc. A lot of these practices are going to spread the virus

<a href="#cmnt_ref2" id="cmnt2">[b]</a>From Taylor:

Yes. Communion has already led to spread, will be important to inform
communities of this risk
