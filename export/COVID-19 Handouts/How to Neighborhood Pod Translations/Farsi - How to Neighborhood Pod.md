Starting a Pod
--------------

-   Print or write out copies of this contact sheet:
    [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fOAJ1FXAVu\_cZN-O2qE9KZ1VFsl3UneAKzty99VK-Dk/edit?usp=sharing](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fOAJ1FXAVu_cZN-O2qE9KZ1VFsl3UneAKzty99VK-Dk/edit?usp%3Dsharing&sa=D&ust=1586527387968000) 
-   Deliver to your neighbors. You might deliver 30+ fliers to the
    houses/apartments right around where you work. Knock, talk through
    the flier with them, and if they aren’t home, leave a flyer (for
    germ avoidance, might be better to just leave the flyer)
-   The flyers are to exchange contact info, in order to start a text
    thread (or whatsapp, signal, slack, facebook messenger, etc.) or a
    phone tree

Building Your Pod
-----------------

-   Create a group chat for your neighborhood and as people text you,
    add them to the group. We recommend Slack, as you can create
    separate channels based on different group needs/interests, but
    whatever works for you all.
-   Troubleshoot as needed - helping folks download and set up WhatsApp,
    answering questions, and asking neighbors to help bring more people
    in.
-   Neighborhood Pods should be between 5 and 30 people or so. If there
    are more than 30 neighbors interested, figure out how to split up
    into two pods.
-   Stay in touch. Use the conversation guide below to get a sense of
    what support needs may come up in your pod. Share any wider
    resources relevant to your community.

Pod Conversation Guide
----------------------

This can be a conversation or you can take notes, compiling a
neighborhood directory with emergency contacts for people. \*\*We
encourage you to use technology to exchange information rather than
doing it in person, to minimize virus spread\*\*

1.  Hi neighbor! We may know each other well -- or we may be meeting for
    the first time. If this is the first time: tell me a little about
    your life! What is your living situation like? Do you have pets?
    What are your days like? Do you have any particular skills or
    hobbies?

1.  What are you concerned about right now in regard to COVID-19? Your
    health or your family’s? Losing work or childcare? Being confined to
    your home?

1.  Who are the main people in your life who you contact about your
    well-being? How do you contact them (by phone, on facebook), and
    would you be open to sharing their contact info with me in case of
    emergency? Who else lives with you, and how can we best contact them
    if need be?

1.  What resources, skills, interests, knowledge do you hold that you
    would be open to sharing with the community?

1.  What do you think is important to share with me and others about
    your health? Dietary restrictions? Where do you pick up prescription
    medicine? Which clinic do you go to?

Organizing & Utilizing Your Pod
-------------------------------

-   Establish a “buddy” system to ensure vulnerable and hard-to-reach
    community members stay connected to COVID-19-related news and
    services
-   Create e-lists through Google Groups that people in your pod can
    join for specific purposes. You can get information for these lists
    by asking pod members to fill out a Google survey form like this
    one:
    [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdsdGeYXv0cH3TxrMQSBp9A0h9dghnVzl\_FajnZdVVAUF2WVg/viewform](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdsdGeYXv0cH3TxrMQSBp9A0h9dghnVzl_FajnZdVVAUF2WVg/viewform&sa=D&ust=1586527387972000)

List examples:

-   An e-list for those seeking/offering childcare if schools close
-   An e-list for those who are willing/able to drive and have access to
    a car that can help with deliveries
-   An e-list for those that can help with food preparation and
    distribution
-   An e-list for people that can help translate materials into
    different languages if you live in a multilingual community
-   An e-list for those seeking/offering financial or physical resources
-   An e-list for those seeking/offering housing
-   Pool together donated financial resources and create a community
    relief fund for those impacted by COVID-19
-   Create and share list of local organizations that need volunteers
-   Keep a list of other pod leaders and their contact information in
    order to build a wider community network
