title: Distribute Aid's COVID-19 Aid Workers Guide
---

## A message from the Distribute Aid team

Since the end of March through the help of many volunteers our COVID-19 information
guide quickly expanded into a full resource packet with 5 comprehensive guides
and 12 information sheet handouts that have been distributed through
networks around the world.

Our resources project has reached hundreds of organisers and helped jumpstart a
number of new aid organisations in the US during the early COVID response. In
times of crisis vulnerable factions of society are often overlooked, but your
dedication helped provide specific resources that allowed for the continued
protection of those who have had to flee their homes and communities.

Now that aid groups have started to operate under their new guidelines and
operational practices, we will wind down our project and only update the
existing guides as new information becomes available.

It has been amazing to see so many people come together to offer their help to
respond to an emerging crisis. In the end, more than a hundred volunteers from
all over the world contributed as researchers, content writers, graphic
designers, translators, law and community advisors.

From the bottom of our hearts the entire Distribute Aid team expresses their
deepest gratitude to all that supported this project!

_THANK YOU &lt;3_
